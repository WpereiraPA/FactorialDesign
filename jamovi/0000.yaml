  This module provides comprehensive tools for factorial design of experiments
  (DOE). It includes analysis for 2-level and 3-level factorial designs,
  calculating main effects, interaction effects, and regression coefficients.
  Ideal for industrial experiments, optimization studies, and research
  applications requiring systematic factor analysis.
